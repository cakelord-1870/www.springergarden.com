    <title>“White powder” on my succulents? Congratulations!</title>
    <author>
      <name>Info Springer Garden</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>Sometimes we would see a dusting of white powder all over the succulents’ leaves. It is normal and natural, grows by, and belongs to succulents themselves. We call it <span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>"bloom", "farina"</strong></span> or<strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;"> “epicuticular wax”</span>.</strong> </p>
<p>We would be panic first because there is a disease called Powdery Mildew. However, we can easily identify the difference. <span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>The farina more like a coating or film, and the mildew more like stains.</strong></span></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/files/blog_1024x1024.jpg?v=1629151283" alt=""></p>
<p>Now we got relief that this is not a disease, but why I say “Congratulations”? <span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>Because Farina is like the “sunscreen”, the thicker the powder, the more healthy and more resistant to sunlight the succulent can be.</strong> </span>The reason for farina is because we all know succulents grow in arid climates or soil conditions, in order to resist some extreme weather and hot summer, the succulents would try to protect themselves, so they will not get hurt.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong><b>We may wonder what is the “farina” for.</b></strong></h4>
<p>Firstly, we already know, work as “sunscreen” to block a lot of direct ultraviolet radiation and thus protect the succulents from sunburn.</p>
<p>Secondly, <span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>farina can prevent excessive rainfall leads leaf corruption</strong></span>. Succulents generally prefer a dry and ventilated place to a dark and damp place. So they secrete the white film to separate the water from the leaves, so the succulents will not get mold. Thirdly, <span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>farina can help to reduce the water evaporation of the succulents</strong></span>. The succulents with farina are more resistant to drought than the others that do not contain farina. They are better nourished than the others and better able to maintain the leaves while keeping water in the root system.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong><b>You may wanna ask, which succulents can grow farina?</b></strong></h4>
<p>Well, if you take a close look at our <a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/korean-rare-succulents">Korean Succulents Collection</a>, it would easily identify if it has farina or not (because most of them are coated). For local succulents, the most common ones are <a href="https://www.springergarden.com/products/echeveria-blue-bird-1?_pos=1&amp;_sid=b8608ce2d&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=40656060645536">Echeveria Blue Bird</a>, <a href="https://www.springergarden.com/products/cotyledon-orbiculata-1?_pos=1&amp;_sid=4aeb09aa3&amp;_ss=r">Cotyledon Orbiculata</a>, and <a href="https://www.springergarden.com/products/graptopetalum-amethystinum?_pos=1&amp;_sid=774ed3058&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=36542695571616">Pachyphytum cv. Momobijin</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong><b>Now we wonder how to create a thick layer of powder for the succulents.</b></strong></h4>
<p><span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>First, do not wipe the leaves and do not touch them.</strong></span></p>
<p>For the fat leaf succulents like Pachyphytum cv. Momobijin and Graptopetalum Amethystinum, <strong>their farina will not fall even after rain. The farina will come back soon after the water dried out</strong>. But remember, do not touch it. Some beginners think the white film does not look good and they will wipe it off, this is not good, once the powder has been wiped off, it is really hard to grow back, especially for some old leaves. If you do not like the water drop stain and want to clean it up, you can use the water spray, but do not use your hand.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>Secondly, take good care of your succulents.</strong></span></p>
<p>For baby succulents, they do not contain much farina, the leaves grow up slowly begin to secrete farina. <strong>This is also the reason why most <a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/korean-rare-succulents">Korean Succulents </a>have a very tick farina because they have very strong roots.</strong> The same, if you want the succulents to have a thick layer of farina, then <strong>they need to have a strong root, so take good care of it</strong>.</p>

    <title>Houseplant Care 101</title>
    <author>
      <name>Info Springer Garden</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/files/20210630.1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1625073570" alt=""></p>
<p>Houseplants are relatively easy to maintain and have benefits including health improvement, mood-boosting and they can also be used as décor themes. With the right maintenance practices, you will have a brightened indoor arena, spiced up with your desired greenery.</p>
<p>Luckily, by mysterious intervention, you have come across this blog and SpringerGarden will give you detailed information about maintenance of houseplants. Let’s dive in!</p>
<h5>
<b>1.<span> </span></b><strong><b>Growing media</b></strong>
</h5>
<p>The medium used to grow houseplants can either be soil or soilless media, which could be a combination of <a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/vermiculite-soil">vermiculite</a>, peat moss, perlite and compost in equal measures. The medium should have good drainage to prevent cases of waterlogging. The soil should be moist but not wet.</p>
<h5>
<b>2.<span> </span></b><strong><b>Water</b></strong>
</h5>
<p>This is one of the toughest maintenance practices. You may think you are underwatering when in the real sense, you are overwatering, which causes plant death. To determine the right amounts of water, water the plants regularly but infrequently. Water the houseplants until water starts escaping through the drainage holes below the pots. <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">Remember to water only when the top one inch of soil feels dry.</span></strong></p>
<h5>
<b>3.<span> </span></b><strong><b>Fertilizer</b></strong>
</h5>
<p>Fertilization ensures that plants retain their happy and healthy state. These fertilizers can either be granular or water-soluble fertilizers.</p>
<p>Fertilizer application depends on the season, time of the year and rate of plant growth.</p>
<p>Do not apply excess fertilizer. It may burn the plants and lead to a stunted growth. In flowering houseplants, use the <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">N:P:K fertilizer</span> </strong>where the three components are relatively of equal measure. Too much nitrogen will produce lots of leaves but lesser flowers.</p>
<h5>
<b>4.<span> </span></b><strong><b>Light</b></strong>
</h5>
<p>This is yet another essential element when it comes to biological processes, especially photosynthesis. However, different houseplants require different amounts of light. Some prefer <strong>low light (less than three hours of light a day), medium light (four to six hours a day)</strong> and <strong>high light (more than six hours of light a day)</strong></p>
<p>(This is the image we are using all the time for locating the light in our room:)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/files/light-guide-drawing-large_1024x1024.jpg?v=1627316131" alt=""></p>
<p>Also, some houseplants prefer bright and direct sunlight while others prefer indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Note that if these plants do not receive the required amounts of light, they will not necessarily die but can stop producing new growth.</p>
<h5>
<b>5.<span> </span></b><strong><b>Temperature </b></strong>
</h5>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">Happy houseplants are found in warm places.</span></strong> Most houseplants do well at temperatures above 55℉. Daytime temperatures range between 65℉ and 75℉ while night temperatures may be cooler by 10 degrees.</p>
<h5>
<b>6.<span> </span></b><strong><b>Pruning and pinching</b></strong>
</h5>
<p>Prune to keep them in good shape so that they do not grow too big. Also, pruning rejuvenates the plant and promotes new growth.</p>
<p>Pinching entails removal of stem tips and the topmost leaves to promote growth of side buds.</p>
<h5>
<b>7.<span> </span></b><strong><b>Deadheading</b></strong>
</h5>
<p>Deadhead flowers and <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">remove any brown, diseased, or dead stems and leaves</span></strong> so that the problem does not spread.</p>
<h5>
<b>8.<span> </span></b><strong><b>Pest and disease control</b></strong>
</h5>
<p>Remove any dead leaves on the growing medium, <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">let the surface of the soil dry out</span></strong> between watering schedules, knock out pests using water from a hosepipe at a high force and also use insecticidal soap to get rid of most pests and diseases.</p>
<h5>
<b>9.<span> </span></b><strong><b>Keep them clean</b></strong>
</h5>
<p>Dust blocks sunlight from reaching the plants. Wipe off any dust using a dry dust cloth, soft paintbrush or moist sponge.</p>
<h6><strong><b>Conclusion </b></strong></h6>

    <title>What happened to my Crassula Rupestris? Why there is no leaf at the bottom part?</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><strong><b>What happened to my </b></strong><strong><b>Crassula Rupestris Var.???</b></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/files/What_happened_to_my_Crassula_Rupestris_Var._2048x2048.jpg?v=1625425965" alt=""></p>
<p>One of our customers sent me a similar photo a few weeks ago. It looks horrible. What happened to this succulent? </p>
<p><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/products/crassula-rupestris-var">Crassula Rupestris Var.</a> belongs to the genus of <a href="https://www.springergarden.com/search?type=article%2Cproduct%2Cpage%2C&amp;q=Crassula">Crassula</a>. The leaves are in the shape of a triangle, growing opposite to each other and cluster together. It looks like a little star, also named Baby's Necklace or kebab bush. The stem is thick and has a high degree of lignification, which looks like the wood branch. Crassula Rupestris Var. <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">grows in autumn and rests in summer, so it is cold-resistant and can stand in sub-zero low temperature</span></strong>. The main propagation method is using its stem.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><b>What is wrong with the dark branches at the bottom?</b></strong></p>
<p>It is quite normal when the lower parts of the necklace turn black, especially in the summer time and if it's an old succulent (all of our Korean Succulents). It is very common in the succulent plants of the genus Crassula, such as Crassula Perforata, Crassula Marnieriana Jade Necklace, Crassula Brevifolia, Crassula Volkensii, Crassula Campfire, etc. We called it “<strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">Blight</span></strong>”. The reason is quite complicated, <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">one can consider as normal consumption and the other may be caused by bad ventilation, too much water in the soil or the burn on the leaves</span></strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><b>What should we do if my Crassula Rupestris becomes like this?</b></strong></p>
<p>If we think about the growth habit and climate condition, the main reason should be lignification of stems and sunburn, as Crassula Rupestris grows in the winter time. If we put them under a high temperature without shade, the sun will cause sunburn and dehydration. Leaf consumption can be very fast, and eventually, the leaves will dry out under this environment.</p>
<p>I suggest <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">moving it to a cool, ventilated place, clean up the dried leaves, keep the good ventilation, and do not put them under the sun</span></strong>. Keep the regular watering (do not over-water to recover it!) Even though it looks ugly now, <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">it will be stunning after autumn</span></strong>! If you do not like this “bald” style, you can cut the stems and try stem-propagation when the weather turns cold. Summer is a hard time for some of the succulents. It will grow back in autumn.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Combined with <span>Crassula Rupestris</span> growth habit and now the climate conditions, <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">the main consideration is lignification stems and sunburn</span></strong>. For <span>Crassula Rupestris</span> in winter, it is resistant to high temperature because there is no shade in time, plus the sun causes sunburn and dehydration. Also, leaf consumption is very fast, so the leaves dry and there is carbonization phenomenon. It is highly advisable to move it to a cool, ventilated place. To conserve, clean up the dead leaves on the branches a little, and restore normal watering. <span>Crassula Rupestris </span>is cutting varieties, if you don't like the following branches bare feeling, you can also prune some branches for cutting reproduction when the weather turns cool, soon after survival can burst the basin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Crassula Rupestris like a sunny, warm, and dry environment, but also can withstand partial shading. Do not expose it to the sun in the summer time. <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">Keep the soil moisturized in its growing season except for extreme weather</span></strong>, to prevent the roots from turning black. For the mass growing Crassula Rupestris, you can also transplant them in separate pots in spring, which is conducive to reduce nutrient consumption. Also, keep the plants well ventilated, which is also helpful to reduce the situation of blackening of the branches!</p>]]>

<p>Make sure you have read this blog first <a href="https://www.springergarden.com/blogs/blog/how-to-take-care-of-korean-succulents-tips-for-succulents-caring-in-different-seasons"><span>How to Take Care of Korean Succulents / Tips for Succulents Caring in Different Seasons</span></a></p>
<p>1. Keeping Korean succulents dry is better than watering them excessively. If the succulents are not in a good condition, watering to save them would be harmful.</p>
<p>2. It is important to note that Korean succulents we are selling are having the clean and short roots. They may tend to be shaky as they have short roots. It is therefore advisable to give them time to develop roots, let them attach to the soil and grow strong.</p>
<p>3. Korean succulents can easily be killed by regular soil like peat due to the high water accumulation capacity. It is therefore advisable to use granular soil because it is hard to crash and has good drainage. To grow succulents, it is recommended that you use a mixture of granular soil and regular soil. <span>Soil is extremely important for planting, check more </span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/blogs/blog/how-to-use-soil-to-help-your-succulent-cuties-grow-better">here</a></p>
<p>4. We recommend using <a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/with-drainage-hole">small planters with drainage holes</a> <span>for Korean succulents, as we can observe the condition of watering with the small planters easily.</span></p>
<p><span>5. The bottom leaves of the succulents would shrink and drop soon when we plant them into the soil. It means they are absorbing the nutrition from the soil and they are growing. It is normal and does not need to be a worry at all.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span>Since Springer Garden Korean Rare Succulents Collection started, more and more succulent lovers ask how to take care of Korean succulents. Korean succulents are easy to care for than local succulents as they are imported from Korea, which has excellent conditions for growing succulents. But remember that, since all the Korean succulents in Springer Garden are without soil, do not water them for the first week after you place them into the soil and planter; give them some time to settle down.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><b><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/blogs/blog/what-we-need-to-do-before-placing-succulents-in-a-new-planter">Here</a> </b></strong>is the article to tell you what we should do before we place them into a new planter.</li>
<li>Soil is also vital for succulents, <strong><b><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/blogs/blog/10-best-granular-soil-for-your-succulents">here</a> </b></strong><strong><b></b></strong>is the article showing you all kinds of soil and formula for soil, <a href="https://www.springergarden.com/blogs/blog/how-to-use-soil-to-help-your-succulent-cuties-grow-better"><strong><b>here</b></strong></a> is the article teaching you how to use the soil.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following tips are not only for Korean succulents but also for all kinds of succulents.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Make Sure Your Succulents Get Enough Light</h3>
<p>Light is extremely important for succulents; it helps succulents to grow healthy and grow colors. I know sunlight is not commonly seen in Canada's land, thus we can supplement light using LED growing light found at Springer Garden.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>Succulents love light and need about six hours of sun per day, depending on the type of succulent.</strong></span> Newly planted succulents can scorch when placed in direct sunlight, so you may need to gradually introduce them to full sun exposure or provide shade with a sheer curtain.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">❄️ Winter</span></h3>
<p>Winter is the most beautiful time for succulents, as long as the temperature difference between day and night is big enough and the light is good enough. It will get colored. So the Full Spectrum LED Grow Light is very good for succulents. They will be super pretty, and the leaves would be super fat.</p>
<p>Don't water them in the coldest time of winter. Water at noon when the sun is shining. I usually water it every 12 to 20 days.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">🌞Spring and Autumn </span></h3>
<p>Caring for succulents in Spring and Autumn caring is the simplest. Give them some sunlight without shading. Make sure you water them once a week, and the water goes through every inch of the soil. Using<span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/with-drainage-hole"><strong><b> planters with the drainage hole</b></strong></a></span><strong><b> </b></strong>would help you a lot. The mixed soil would be helpful for succulents. Here are <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/blogs/blog/some-tips-for-succulents-sunbathing"><strong><b>some tips for succulents sunbathing</b></strong></a></span>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">🍉 Summer</span></h3>
<p>When the temperature is above 33 degrees, we should pay attention to the sun in the morning. Do not burn the succulents (Here are <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/blogs/blog/what-should-we-do-if-we-burned-our-succulents"><strong><b>tips for what you should do if you burn your succulents</b></strong></a></span>). Very high temperatures are detrimental. They can burn the plants and they will eventually die.</p>
<p>To prevent this, <span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>spray a little water at night, but be sure to have good ventilation</strong></span>! Otherwise, it's easy to get sick and develop black rot. Watering should better be done in the evening. Do not put them in the rain for few days. Put them under the sunlight after the rain, but the occasional rain is good for them. In short, do not expose them to the sun for a long time, no continuing raining, do not put them indoors for hours, and maintain the good ventilation. Otherwise, it will die, and the roots and leaves will turn black. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Succulents are easy to care for, but the fact seems not. However, if you pay great attention and care to them, they will grow strong and beautiful!</p>

<h1><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What <a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/succulent-soil">soils</a> do succulents like? </span></h1>
<ol>
<li>
<span></span>Our Springer Garden succulents love <span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>loose and ventilated soils</strong></span>, and <span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>their roots need a lot of oxygen</strong></span>. Any hard and hot soil would easily damage the root, and the lack of oxygen will breed many anaerobic bacteria.</li>
<li>
<span></span>They also love soils that are <span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>easy to drain and have a certain water-holding ability</strong></span>. The original soil for growing succulents is sandy. The root system does not adapt to soak in the water. The most suitable environment for growth is to keep the plant in a moist and not wet state for a long time. If it is hard to maintain, remember the rule, better dry than wet.</li>
<li>
<span></span><span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>Root-affinity</strong></span>, not easy to crush. Root-affinity refers to the ability of roots to adhere to soil particles, and the size of soil particles is different in different times. At the beginning, you can use <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/vermiculite-soil"><strong><b>vermiculite</b></strong></a></span>, and when the seedlings develop a slightly larger root, the granular soil can be used. The interior structure of the granular soil also determines whether the roots will go inside the soil. When the roots grow into the soil, they break the soil structure, and the granular soil is easily crushed and becomes dust, which easily sticks together after watering, especially in alkaline environments. Once they are all stuck together, there will be no air circulation for roots, and plants will die. So that's why we mix the soil with different sizes and change it twice a year.</li>
<li>
<span></span>Springer Garden succulents require a little <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/ceramic-nutrient-soil"><strong><b>fertilizer</b></strong></a></span>. They do not need much fertilization. Their ancestors could survive without fertilizer, but it would be better to give them fertilizer nutrients with low nitrogen and high phosphorus and potassium during the growing season to promote better growth. Why are they low in nitrogen and high in phosphorus potassium? Because nitrogen can promote the plants to grow leaves, and phosphorus promotes flower bud differentiation; potassium promotes root growth.</li>
<li>Be careful <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">not to over fertilize and burn roots</span></strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h1><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The rules of using soil</span></h1>
<p>No matter which soil you choose and how to prepare it, it should meet the basic requirements of plants, and consider all aspects of the situation, be flexible.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span></span><strong>According to the planting site</strong>: the soil for the field planting and pot planting is different. All you need to consider in field planting is drainage. It is recommended that you should add more materials with strong drainage, such as gravel. On the other hand, potted succulents should have loose ventilation and be easy to add organic matter appropriately. If planted in the south balcony, consider drier, adequate light characteristics, and add some water retention strong matrix, such as <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/vermiculite-soil"><strong><b>vermiculite</b></strong></a></span>.</li>
<li>
<span></span><strong>According to plant species</strong>: Different soil types can be "quite different." For example, epiphytic species require certain humus. In contrast, some terrestrial species with poor soil and underdeveloped roots of origin require less humus than the epiphytic species. Different species of families and genera require different soils.</li>
<li>
<span></span><strong>According to different cultivation areas</strong>: the northern climate is dry, the moisture ability of the soil has certain requirements; abundant Southern rain, air humidity, soil drainage, and ventilation requirements are higher. </li>
<li>
<span></span><strong>Mix according to different growth stages</strong>: in the seedling stage, the root system is not developed, the organic matter content should be slightly less, and the soil is mainly composed of light materials and some fine sand, and then gradually increase the organic matter content later as they grow. </li>
</ol>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/files/3fd73be8d223154576ce5ad6fbf23ed_600x600.jpg?v=1600389484" alt=""></span></p>
<h1><strong><b>The functions of different soils</b></strong></h1>
<p>[On the bottom] The bottom of the basin must be paved with a layer of large particles, which can be breathable and permeable. Large particles of <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/ceramsite"><strong><b>ceramicist</b></strong></a></span> and lava soil can be used as stones at the bottom. </p>
<p>[On the top] <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/akadama"><strong><b>Akadam</b></strong></a></span><strong><b>a</b></strong> and <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/kanuma-soil"><strong><b>Kanuma Pumice</b></strong></a></span> will be pulverized after a period of use, so it is not recommended to use them as the soil cover. I usually use Maifanitum and Perlite. Many beautiful <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/colored-stones"><strong><b>decorative stones</b></strong></a></span> can be paving stones. </p>

    <title>10 Best Granular Soil For Your Succulents</title>
    <author>

      <![CDATA[<meta charset="UTF-8">
<p>Are you a professional or enthusiast gardener looking to grow succulents? Well, Springer Garden has everything you need for your succulents. We also give advice on requirements and maintenance practices for healthy and vigorous plants.</p>
<p>Springer Garden has almost all types of soils you need for your plants. People may ask, what is the difference between these soil types? Is soil important for plants? The answer is yes. Most succulent soils have components that help balance water retention and water drainage, but they all do it differently. Generally, <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/succulent-soil"><strong><b>Succulent Soil</b></strong></a></span> = Regular Soil + Granular Soil.</p>
<p><strong><b>For most succulents</b></strong>: add two parts inorganic grit to one part organic (i.e., plant-based) material, like compost or coir. Or simply mix half-and-half bagged potting soil (which can be obtained from any nursery or garden center and granular soil.)</p>
<p><strong><b>For fat succulents</b></strong> like cactus, euphorbias, and pachyphytums, add one part bagged soil to two parts granular soil.</p>
<p><strong><b>For thin-leaved succulents</b></strong> like dainty sedums and others that don't store much moisture, add two parts bagged soil to one part granular soil.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>MAIFANITUM</h1>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/products/Maifanitum-Big_600x600.jpg?v=1602960421" alt=""></p>
<p>Tried and tested at Springer Garden, maifanitum is the most popular type of granular soil by far (because of the market promotion). </p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/maifanitum"><strong><b>Maifanitum</b></strong></a></span> is formed by volcanic eruptions and is rich in trace elements. It also has the exceptional advantage of absorbing moisture from the air (hence using some as a root trap for decapitated plants), water-retaining and water-exhausting.</p>
<p>It is a compound mineral or medicinal rock that is non-toxic and harmless to living organisms and has particular biological role.</p>
<p>The main chemical composition of maifenstone is inorganic silicoaluminate. It includes SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, FeO, MgO, CaO, K2O, Na2O, TiO2, P2O5, MnO, etc. It also contains all the major elements needed by animals, such as K, Na, Ca, Mg, Cu, Mo, and other trace elements and rare earth elements, about 58 kinds.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>LAVA SOIL</h1>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/products/RED-LAVA_600x600.jpg?v=1602960565" alt=""></p>
<div style="text-align: start;"><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/soil-mix-lava" title="Mix Lava"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/products/whitelava_600x600.jpg?v=1603034822" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p> </p>
<p>There are slight differences between <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/black-lava"><strong><b>Black Lava Soil</b></strong></a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/red-lava"><strong><b>Red Lava Soil</b></strong></a></span>, and <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/white-lava"><strong><b>White Lava Soil</b></strong></a></span> apart from the color. Color is important when you use this soil as a paving stone. The black one is easy to absorb heat, so I do not recommend it.</p>
<p>The porous stone formed after the volcanic eruption is very precious. When erupting, the magma that erupts has gas slag, a solid magma. Temperature and pressure drop quickly and chemical and physical changes take place, so the magma becomes volcanic. It contains a large amount of silicon, potassium, sodium, iron, magnesium, 26 kinds of mineral elements, copper, zinc, chromium, nickel, manganese, and so on.</p>
<p>After heating, the volcanic rock releases many misty energy ions, which produce a magnetic effect, thermothermal effect, cold and hot effect.</p>
<p>Volcanic rocks are rich in trace elements, which are also produced by their accumulation. However, they are so heavy, thus they will sink to the bottom after watering for a while.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>AKADAMA</h1>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/products/Akadama_600x600.jpg?v=1602959955" alt=""> </p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/akadama"><strong><b>Akadama</b></strong></a></span>, aka red ball earth, is a naturally occurring, granular clay-like mineral used as soil for bonsai trees and other container-grown plants. It is widely known for its weak acidity, water retention capacity, and breathability, made from volcanic ash and commonly cultivated in Japan. Noticeable discoloration after water absorption can help monitor the degree of dry and wet soil and judge the watering cycle.</p>
<p>Akadama's color darkens when moist, which helps the grower determine when to water a tree. However, it is easy to cause soil compaction due to pulverization, so it is not recommended to use in large amounts.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><span>Ceramsite</span></h1>
<p><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/ceramsite" title="ceramsite"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/products/Ceramsite_600x600.jpg?v=1602959974" alt=""></a></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/ceramsite"><strong><b>Ceramsite</b></strong></a></span> is commonly used as pelvic floor stone, and it is poured on the pelvic floor. Most of them are round or elliptic spheres, but some imitators are not round or elliptic spheres. Still, irregular gravel shape, rigid, usually on the bottom of the pot ceramic, can prevent the root from over wetting.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><span>Vermiculite</span></h1>
<p><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/vermiculite-soil%20" title="vermiculite-soil "><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/products/VermiculiteSoil_600x600.jpg?v=1602960064" alt=""></a></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/vermiculite-soil%20"><strong><b>Vermiculite</b></strong></a></span> soil has a mica-like structure. It is a hydrous phyllosilicate mineral that undergoes significant expansion when heated. It breaks easily and expands after absorbing water. It is characterized by its high water retention capacity.</p>
<p>Exfoliation occurs when the mineral is well-heated, and commercial furnaces can regularly produce this effect.</p>
<p>Vermiculite forms by the weathering or hydrothermal alteration of biotite or phlogopite. It has a comprehensive feature that is slightly better than perlite, which you can use to regulate soil moisture. The quality of each peddler is uneven and the difference is big. You can feel that the color is lighter, which is better and the challenge is that the kind of brown broke usually open at ago.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><span>Green Zeolite</span></h1>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/products/greenstone_600x600.jpg?v=1602960348" alt=""></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/green-zeolite">Green Zeolite</a></strong> is a combination of pumice and zeolite, which is named based on its color, and has the same effect as pumice. It is an excellent insect control and decorative effect.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Ceramic Nutrient Soil</h1>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/products/CeramicNutrientSoil_600x600.jpg?v=1602959967" alt=""></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/products/ceramic-nutrient-soil"><strong><b>Ceramic nutrient soil</b></strong></a></span> is not granular soil but fertilizer; it has good water retention and adsorption, it can absorb moisture in the air and harmful gas. It is also used as a plant matrix, can loose breath freely, does not harden, does not pulverize, and it is generally clean.</p>
<p>The advantages are that there is no breeding ground for flies and rich in fleshy plants need to grow all kinds of nutrients and trace elements.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><span>Fertilizer</span></h1>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/products/FERTILIZER_600x600.jpg?v=1603033063" alt=""></span></p>
<p>It is a regular fertilizer, which is good for growing succulents.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>MIX LAVA</h1>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/products/MIXLAVA_600x600.jpg?v=1603033120" alt=""></p>
<p>If you are a freshman in the succulent world and the soil above makes you confused, you can choose <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/soil-mix-lava"><strong><b>Mix Lava Soil</b></strong></a></span>. We mix everything listed altogether using our formula, making sure your succulents can be well fertilized.</p>
<p> </p>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<h1><span>Kanuma Pumice</span></h1>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/products/Kanumasoil_600x600.jpg?v=1602960881" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/kanuma-soil"><strong><b>Kanuma Pumice</b></strong></a></span> is produced in the Tochigi and Ibaraki areas, with exceptionally high-quality soil yielded in the city of Kanuma, hence the name Kanuma soil. Its geological name is Kanuma pumice, and its primary components are silica and aluminum. It is acidic (pH 4 to 6) and mainly used for succulents, Satsuki azalea, and rhododendron bonsai. It is a rare material produced in the volcanic mountains.</p>
<p>The lower volcanic soil generates it. In volcanic sand, pH is acidic, has a high permeability, water retention, ventilation and the trace element level is ok, but not as <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/akadama"><strong><b>Akadama</b></strong></a></span>. Kanuma Pumice is not very uniform in size and has many holes. I wouldn't say I like to use it as paving soil because it is too easy to pulverize the granules.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><span>Perlite</span></h1>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/products/whitestone_600x600.jpg?v=1602960007" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span><strong><b>Perlite</b></strong></span> is a volcanic eruption of acid lava, rapidly cooled into vitreous rock, named for its pearl-fissured structure. Perlite is the cheapest particle, light in weight and easily floats when watered, so many people think it is foam, so they are not very useful particles. I wouldn't say I like it.</p>

<p>The Aglaonema is a mainstay of favorite houseplant lists everywhere! With its unique and lush foliage, easy care, and ability to adapt to almost any home or office space, it’s hard to find a more versatile stunner.</p>
<p>Commonly called the “Chinese Evergreen”, this plant is native to the tropical forest floors of Asia, and so appreciates a spot where it can receive indirect light as direct sunlight can scorch its leaves. Keeping it a few feet from a well lit window where it can receive bright diffused light is ideal; however, the Aglaonema can tolerate lower light levels and even fluorescent lighting conditions.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about the lighting conditions in your home or office, read our guide for <a href="http://greenerynyc.com/how-to-measure-lighting-for-plants/">how to measure light in your space.</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>PRO TIP:</b><span> The Aglaonema is one of a handful of plants that can adapt to fluorescent lighting conditions. Combined with its relatively low watering demands and beautifully variegated leaves, it’s a strong and original choice for an office plant!</span></p>
<div id="s-7a9b1b86-4988-4273-ad89-0e357a10d6b0" class="shg-c  ">
<section class="plant-care-section" id="routine-maintenance">
<h2><span>Routine Maintenance</span></h2>
<div class="grid">
<div class="grid__item">
<p>Always be sure to assess your plant’s watering needs upon receiving it. Before giving your plant a drink, it is best to check the moisture level in the soil first using your finger or a soil probe. You may also consider aerating the soil of your plant before the initial watering. We compact the soil to avoid shifting during transit, so aerating can help the soil breathe and allow moisture to be released.</p>
<p>Aglaonema like to dry out between waterings, so feel the soil with your finger a few inches down to ensure it isn’t moist right beneath the surface. If your plant is in a bright location, then you will want to water it when the soil is dry halfway down the root mass (if you have a taller planter, sometimes moisture can build up in the bottom of the container so keep that in mind). If you have your plant in fluorescent or lower light conditions, then it’s best to let the soil dry out almost all the way to the bottom of the pot before watering thoroughly.</p>
<p>Be weary of overwatering with this plant as it can be prone to root rot. The key signs of overwatering are yellowing or mushy stalks or leaves. If you find this occurring then it’s best to let the soil dry out completely before watering again, and to follow careful watering patterns going forward.</p>
<p>Rotate your plant periodically to ensure even growth on all sides and dust the leaves often so the plant can photosynthesize efficiently. This is especially important if the plant is in a lower light location<span>, </span><span>as the plant’s ability to photosynthesize is decreased in lower-light conditions</span>. When dusting the leaves, also take the opportunity to inspect the undersides and keep an eye out for pests.</p>
<p>Remember each plant is a unique living thing and may have varying needs, <span> many of which are dependent on a plant’s specific location</span>. Pay attention to the condition of your Aglaonema and its watering needs and you will have a long and happy relationship.</p>
<p><b>PRO TIP:</b><span> Keep your plant away from hot and cold air drafts. This includes window breezes, heaters, and air conditioning. Aglaonemas prefer temperatures between 70 and 85 degrees fahrenheit. Night time temperatures should not vary more than a 10 degrees drop.</span></p>

<h2><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
<div class="questions">
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Help! My Aglaonema has yellow or brown leaves shortly after receiving it.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="answer">This is most likely due to transplant shock. Transplant shock is totally normal, and almost all plants experience some form of it by losing a few leaves or showing some discoloration upon arriving to a new environment. Prune off any unsightly leaves and be sure to follow the plant's specific care instructions. If the problem persists<span>, then the </span><span>lighting</span><span> and/or watering patterns may </span>need adjusting. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Why are my Aglaonema leaves drooping?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="answer">
<span>Droopy leaves can be an indication of insufficient lighting or improper watering.  If receiving too much direct sun, Aglaonema foliage may curl under for protection against sunburn.</span> In <span>insufficient</span> light, the leaves can also begin to wilt and show signs of weakness. A combination of yellow and brown leaf margins, moist soil, and droopy leaves is often a result of too much water. Crispy, fully yellow or brown leaves and dry soil is typically a result of too little water. If you are experiencing these symptoms, refer to the Aglaonema care guide and adjust either lighting or watering as needed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Why are the stalks of my Aglaonema turning yellow and brown?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="answer">This is most frequently caused by too much moisture being held in the soil, causing the roots to rot. Aglaonema stalks retain water for the plant in periods of drought. If there is too much water in the soil and the stalks are also full of water, this can cause the plant to rot. In this case, hold off on watering, aerate (or in severe cases replace) the soil, and prune away any rotting stalks. Water the plant again only when the soil has dried completely throughout the pot.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="question">
<p><strong>How often should I fertilize my plant?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="answer">In general, houseplants will thrive when they are fertilized Spring through Fall. Fertilize once every 6 weeks with an organic houseplant fertilizer, following the package instructions for dilution and administration. Greenery Unlimited uses an organic potting mix with a slow release fertilizer in the soil, so your plant will not need fertilizer within the first 6 months of receiving it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="question">
<p><strong>How often does my plant need to be repotted?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="answer">For smaller desktop plants, we suggest repotting once every 12-18 months. Choose a potting vessel 1”- 2” larger in diameter to allow for growth. Don’t choose a pot much larger than the previous as this could hold excessive moisture and drown the plant's roots if you're inexperienced with indoor plant care. If you prefer to maintain the current size of your plant, repot into the same vessel, providing new soil and trimming away some roots and foliage. Spring or summer is the ideal time for repotting as plants are at their strongest during the growing season.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="answer">For larger floor plants, we suggest repotting every 18-24 months. Choose a potting vessel 2”- 4” larger in diameter to allow for growth. Don’t choose a pot much larger than the previous as this could hold excessive moisture and drown the plant's roots if you're inexperienced with indoor plant care. If you prefer to maintain the current size of your plant, repot into the same vessel, providing new soil and trimming away some roots and foliage. Spring or summer is the ideal time for repotting as plants are at their strongest during the growing season.</li>

</div>
<p>You cannot find any area that looks like the nodes described on multiple websites and forums but you decide to try it anyway.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Propagate Monstera without node? Is it even possible?</strong></p>
<p>Before you are getting too excited, let’s get right to the point. Propagating a Monstera with just a stem and no nodes is not possible. A stem itself is not sufficient.</p>
<p>At least one node is necessary to successfully propagate a Monstera plant.</p>
<p>You can however put a leaf with a petiole in a vase and it will look good for months. A petiole is a part that connects the leaf to a stem.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">A node on the other hand is where the petiole connects with the stem. Each leaf has come out of a petiole before.</p>
<div id="content_3_btf_wrapper" class="adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper mv-size-300x250" data-wrapper="content_3_btf">
<div id="content_3_btf" class="content_btf adunit"></div>
<div class="adunitlabel"></div>
</div>
<p>Aerial roots on the other hand are roots that come out of the stem. If such are present the chances of successfully propagating a Monstera cutting increase.</p>
<p>Let’s now look into what a node is in more detail and what a good cutting that can be propagated looks like.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>CAN A MONSTERA CUTTING WITHOUT A NODE GROW ROOTS?</h2>
<p>The interesting thing with a Monstera cutting without a node is that it might actually grow roots eventually.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">When you keep your Monstera without a node in a glass of water for several months, it might actually grow roots. </p>
<div id="content_5_btf_wrapper" class="adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper mv-size-300x250" data-wrapper="content_5_btf">
<div id="content_5_btf" class="content_btf adunit" data-google-query-id="CL6fjbbE7OsCFXMsAQodg5ILOQ">
<div id="google_ads_iframe_/1030006/plantophiles/content_9__container__"></div>
</div>
<div class="adunitlabel"></div>
</div>
<p>But don’t be fooled, even when the Monstera cutting grows roots it will never turn into a full plant. People are posting questions and pictures of Monstera cuttings without nodes almost every single day.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure id="attachment_8238" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8238" class="wp-caption aligncenter" data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">
<div class="ss-on-media-container size-full wp-image-8238"><span class="ss-on-media-image-wrap size-full wp-image-8238"><picture loading="lazy" class="ss-on-media-img size-full wp-image-8238 sp-no-webp"><source srcset="https://plantophiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-7.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://plantophiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-7.png" type="image/png"></source></picture></span></div>
</figure>
<p>It is understandable that they would like to grow these cuttings into a full plant and the forming of roots reinforces the hopes of doing so.</p>
<p>To sum it up. A Monstera without node will not be viable and cannot turn into a full plant. It can start to grow roots directly from the petiole. However, since a node is missing it cannot turn into a full plant.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>NODES AND INTERNODES IN PLANTS</h2>
<figure id="attachment_8223" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8223" class="wp-caption aligncenter" data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">

</div>
<p>Plants consist of nodes and internodes. Nodes are the area where petioles grow. Petioles itself are the “stems” that the leaves are connected to according to<span> </span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/node-plant#:~:text=nodes%20(points%20where%20leaves%20are,the%20distance%20between%20buds%20(internode%E2%80%A6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>. </p>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">The area between two nodes is called an internode or stem.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3>WHAT IS A NODE?</h3>
<p>A node can be described as an essential organ of a plant. Without one, you do not have a fully functional plant but merely a cutting that will never turn into a clone of your mother plant.</p>
<p>Nodes itself are controlling the growth of buds. Buds are where the new leaves, stems, shoots, or flowers are emerging from.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true"> </p>

<div class="adunitlabel"></div>
</div>
<h3>WHERE TO FIND A NODE?</h3>
<p>Notes can be found where the leaf, bud branch, or twig is. These sections of a plant always contain a node. Further signs of a node can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A knobby piece on the stem of a plant</li>
<li>An area where the stem is thicker</li>
<li>Scars can indicate where a leaf was</li>
<li>Solid areas of a stem</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>MONSTERA NODE</h3>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">The node is the part of a Monstera plant where new roots and leaves, as well as petioles, emerge. It is brown and circular. Each of the nodes has the potential to grow one leaf and multiple roots.</p>
<div id="content_10_btf_wrapper" class="adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper mv-size-728x280" data-wrapper="content_10_btf">
<div id="content_10_btf" class="content_btf adunit" data-google-query-id="CN-K9LbE7OsCFQyfAQodbw4EHQ">
<div id="google_ads_iframe_/1030006/plantophiles/content_13__container__"></div>
</div>
</div>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">The roots that come out of a Monstera stem are called air roots.</p>
<p>Let’s now have a look at propagating a Monstera plant cutting without a leaf.  Is that possible at all?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>PROPAGATING MONSTERA WITHOUT LEAF</h2>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">You might ask if you can turn a Monstera cutting without a leaf into a full plant? </p>
<div id="content_12_btf_wrapper" class="adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper mv-size-300x250" data-wrapper="content_12_btf">
<div id="content_12_btf" class="content_btf adunit" data-google-query-id="CIainbfE7OsCFVRgAQodYpMO_g">
<div id="google_ads_iframe_/1030006/plantophiles/content_16__container__"></div>
</div>
<div class="adunitlabel"></div>
</div>
<p>I can tell you from personal experience that this is possible as I have done it many many times. A leaf is certainly helpful as it speeds up the process considerably. </p>
<p>A Monstera cutting with a node and no leaf will take its time before it grows roots and eventually grows its first leaf.</p>
<p>A much faster way is to have a cutting that has at least one leaf. Stems with a node and no leaf are often called wet sticks on the interwebs. </p>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">People are joking about them as they are often sold for quite a lot of money. Especially if it is a<span> </span><a href="https://plantophiles.com/plant-care/variegated-monstera-deliciosa-care-and-propagation/">Monstera Deliciosa Borsigiana</a><span> </span>wet stick.</p>
<div id="content_13_btf_wrapper" class="adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper mv-size-300x250" data-wrapper="content_13_btf">
<div id="content_13_btf" class="content_btf adunit" data-google-query-id="CJTWhrfE7OsCFRJ7AQodoY4JGw">
<div id="google_ads_iframe_/1030006/plantophiles/content_15__container__"></div>
</div>
<div class="adunitlabel"></div>
</div>
<p>However, the difference between a scammer and someone that sells you a viable cutting with the potential to turn into a new clone of the Monstera plant the cutting is coming from is whether the cutting has a node or not.</p>
<p>No node no new plant. It’s that simple.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHERE TO CUT A MONSTERA FOR PROPAGATION</h2>
<p>When cutting a Monstera plant, always cut just above a node. As we have learned the node is controlling the growth of new leaves, shoots, and buds.</p>
<p>The node itself will, therefore, make sure that your plant can continue to grow.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">The cutting itself should also contain at least one node to be a viable cutting for propagation. Cuttings itself can be either cut from the top, called a top cutting, or any other section with a node.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT PROPAGATING MONSTERA WITHOUT NODE</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Propagating Monstera without node, is it possible?</strong></p>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">Propagating Monstera without node is not feasible as a Monstera cutting needs at least one node for propagation. The node is like the brain containing the blueprints for further plant growth. Without the presence of a node no new leaf can form and the cutting itself will not turn into a full plant.</p>
<div id="content_15_btf_wrapper" class="adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper mv-size-300x250" data-wrapper="content_15_btf">
<div id="content_15_btf" class="content_btf adunit" data-google-query-id="CPD2tLfE7OsCFQZQAQodo0AOSw">
<div id="google_ads_iframe_/1030006/plantophiles/content_18__container__"></div>
</div>
<div class="adunitlabel"></div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can a Monstera cutting with just a leaf grow roots?</strong></p>
<p>Monstera cuttings without nodes can grow roots if kept in water for several months. These cutting however cannot turn into a full plant. A clone of the mother plant is not achievable. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can other plants be propagated from leaves?</strong></p>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">Depending on the species of plant they can be propagated from leaves. Many succulents and cacti can be propagated from leaves. Further examples of plants that can be propagated from just leaves and a stem are<span> </span><a href="https://plantophiles.com/plant-care/pilea-peperomioides/">Pilea Peperomioides</a>,<span> </span><a href="https://plantophiles.com/plant-care/sansevieria/">Sansevieria</a><span> </span>can be propagated straight from leaves. </p>
<p><strong>Can a Monstera cutting with a node and no leaves be propagated?</strong></p>
<p>Monstera cuttings with at least one node are fully capable to turn into full plants. However, the lack of a leaf will significantly increase the time until new roots and a leaf are produced.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>CONCLUSION ABOUT PROPAGATING MONSTERA WITHOUT NODE</h2>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">Propagating Monstera without node is something you rarely do as the only benefit this would have is that you prune back your plant. Why not go a bit lower and include a node. </p>
<div id="content_17_btf_wrapper" class="adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper mv-size-300x250" data-wrapper="content_17_btf">

<div id="google_ads_iframe_/1030006/plantophiles/content_20__container__"></div>
</div>
<div class="adunitlabel"></div>
</div>
<p>This way you get yourself a backup plan in case anything goes wrong or you have a cutting that you can gift a friend. </p>
<p>If you are anything like me you might want to trade or even sell your Monstera Variegata cutting to buy even more plants or to get a plant that you do not own yet.</p>

    <title>How to take good care of succulents in Summer Time</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/files/dfbc7b231b43a5d07a3988548359627_large.jpg?v=1590637691" alt="" width="542" height="271"></p>
<p>Golden summer is the time for wearing a fairy skirt and enjoy the holiday, and it is also the time to enjoy the freezing beer and watching games. For the succulent lovers, the continuous high temperature and high humidity are the strongest plant killers. However, this should not be something to worry about. With the proper care, it is no big deal if you want to have a peaceful summer for plants. Here are some tips for caring for succulents in summertime.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><b>Light</b></strong></p>
<p>Experts from Springer Garden found out that frequent exposure to the sun makes the succulents more colorful and compact. It is better to have more than 3 hours of sunlight a day. When the temperature goes beyond 30℃ between 11 am and 2 pm with the strongest light in a day, <span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>protect the succulents from direct sunlight to avoid sunburn</strong></span>. Use <a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/new-arrival/products/sun-mesh-shade-sunblock">Sun Mesh Shade Sunblock</a> when necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><b>Temperature</b></strong></p>
<p>If the temperature is high and stuffy, it's best to <span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>move the succulents indoors</strong></span>, give them shade, or use sunscreen or an umbrella. If you live in an underlit condo, it is best to place the succulents near a window or use ultraviolet light to increase the light.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><b>Watering</b></strong></p>
<p>Many people say that there is less water in summer, but plants may need more water because the summer temperature is high and the water evaporates quickly. So the timing of watering is the key.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>Do not water them in the daytime.</strong> </span>The temperature inside the pot is extremely high, the same as the water temperature. It is equivalent to boil the root, which will kill them.</p>
<p>Please do not put the water directly on the leaf because it would make the light focused and burn the leaves. The time for watering must be in the evening after the temperature has fallen. The time phrase can be once a week or bi-weekly. You must water thoroughly, ensure to moisture the soil. We can check the soil by sticking a toothpick or chopsticks in a pot.</p>
<p>We say, "<span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>High temperature no high humidity, high humidity no high temperature.</strong></span>" Remember, high humidity weather cannot water succulents. Water again!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><b>Ventilation</b></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>Ventilation is essential for succulents to enjoy a safe summer</strong></span>, so keep windows open. If you live in a condo, the best place for succulents is an open area, or use a small electric fan if there is no wind at all. Choosing planters with good air permeability is important, such as those <a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/with-drainage-hole">planters with drainage holes from Springer Garden</a>.</p>

<p>(If your baby looks like this, it is rooted, which grows really tall and there are no leaves in the between)</p>
<p>Succulents are hardy plants that add a striking appearance to any garden or home. Performing best in U.S. Department of Agriculture hardiness zones 3 through 9, succulents are good plants for the novice and expert gardener alike, as they require little attention. Because succulents are desert plants, they should be watered sparingly. Succulents are typically not susceptible to insect or pest infestation, but overwatering can lead to black stem rot, a preventable and easily fixable disease. Succulents with signs of black stem rot should be treated immediately.</p>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<div class="section-1">
<p>Check the plant for infected areas. These typically appear as dark brown to black spots or areas on the low part of the plant. Other signs of black stem rot include puckered flesh with a dark tint around the infected area.</p>

<div class="section-2">
<p>Stop watering a plant with rot. Remove the plant from its pot. Remove the soil mixture and clean out the pot thoroughly to ensure no remnants of the fungus are left.</p>

<div class="section-3">
<p>Cut the infected black stem from the plant with a garden knife. Let the healthy portion of the plant dry naturally for several hours, keeping the succulent out of direct sunlight during this process. If other areas of the plant are showing minimal signs of rot, keep an eye on the plant. Succulents can recover from stem rot if properly watered and placed in a warm, dry location.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="section-4">
<p>Using the cleaned out pot or a fresh one, combine equal parts soil, coarse sand, and peat moss. Don't reuse any of the materials used with the infected plant.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="section-5">
<p>Pour roughly 2 inches of the mixture into the pot. Place the newly doctored succulent into the pot with the roots lying on top of the soil. Fill the pot with the soil mixture until it reaches the base of the stems. Firmly pat the soil around the plant.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="section-6">
<p>Place the succulent in a brightly lit spot with warm temperatures. Succulents prefer dry climates, so don't place the plant in a humid location.</p>
</div>

<div class="section-7">
<p>Water the plant with just enough water to moisten the soil one week after repotting. After the soil has completely dried out, you can water more thoroughly.</p>

<h4>Tip</h4>
<p>Succulents grow best in well-drained soils that provide high water-holding capacity. Planting succulents in a clay pot with a drainage hole ensures there is no sitting water and that the soil dries out between waterings. Succulents are dormant during the winter and should only be watered lightly at this time.</p>
</div>
<div id="warnings" class="section">
<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>In addition to black stem rot, succulents may be susceptible to sunburn or frost damage. Sunburn can occur when succulents are hastily moved from a shady spot to one that receives direct sunlight. You may notice a whitish discoloring on the leaves, or in severe cases, a brown scar in the affected areas. While it is uncommon for insects to attack succulents, check your plant regularly for mites, mealybugs, and scale.</p>

    <title>What should we do if we burned our succulents</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0104/6691/8457/files/12312312_large.jpg?v=1572233991" alt=""></p>
<p><strong><b>Cause</b></strong></p>
<p>This is because plants have not been exposed to sunlight for a long time (indoors) and then they are suddenly exposed to bright light (most commonly). </p>
<p>When water droplets remain on the leaves, they are exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>The light is too bright at the end of summer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong><b>Solution</b></strong></h4>
<p>With Springer Garden, you will always find a solution to all your plant problems. Our experts state that succulents raised indoors for a long time and succulents just taken into the planter should be closely monitored to control the time of illumination and shading when taken outside. <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">It is better to increase the frequency of 2 hours every two days, for example, 2 hours on the first day, 2 hours on the second day, 4 hours on the third day, and 4 hours on the fourth day</span></strong>, to help the succulents adapt to the environment.</p>
<p>Don't expose the succulents to the sun after watering. They should stay in the sun for a day or two.</p>
<p>It would be best if you managed unburned succulents according to the degree of sunburn:</p>
<p><strong><b>Light sunburn:</b></strong> A small part of the leaves of the meat have sunburn. Provide timely shading to help the plants adapt to the environment before continuing to bask.</p>
<p><strong><b>Moderate sunburn:</b></strong> The top of the succulent is dried, and the burned area needs to be removed to avoid infection. </p>
<p><strong><b>Severe sunburn: </b></strong>Almost the entire plant is sunburned. Hydration leads to black rot. Unfortunately, it is estimated that there is no way to save. Be prepared to lose it.</p>

<p><span>Most of our planters have the drainage hole at the bottom, which would help the plant to breathe. Make sure the water goes through the hole when you watering your plant, it means they have drunk enough water.</span></p>

    <title>Some tips for succulents sunbathing</title>
    <author>
      <name>Info Springer Garden</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><strong><b>Summer is here, and the sun is extremely hot!</b></strong></p>
<p>Remember when you give your succulents the sunbath, <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">do not put them under the scorching sunlight</span></strong> that would burn them down. The leaves of your succulents would turn black and shrink.</p>
<p>But do not worry, it does not mean they are dead; just put them indoor and keep good ventilation; they will recover soon.</p>
<p><em><strong><b>How should succulents preserve the shape? The Internet is full of advice. Who should we trust? Does more light mean it is better?</b></strong></em></p>
<p>Everyone's maintenance methods are different, and many planting masters have their way of maintenance! So there is no right or wrong; as long as the succulents are raised well is a good way.</p>
<p>🍃In my opinion, if succulents act as a decoration in the home, we can put them near the window. Please <strong><span style="color: #ff2a00;">don't put them close to the washroom, or in a place without sunshine</span></strong>. It is possible to take the sunbath through the glass, but the watering must be done at night. Do not water them in the daytime, or it would be a "sauna" for them, then their leaves would turn black and change the water. It would also be best not to pour the water on the leaves.</p>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<p><span>🍃</span>The indoor ventilation is not as good as outdoor, so it would be easy to leave the water on the leaves and burn the leaves.</p>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<p><span>🍃</span>If you want to take good care of the succulents, there are more considerations. For example, it is best to put the succulents outdoor and <span style="color: #ff2a00;"><strong>expose them to different temperatures day and night. It would be easy for them to get the color.</strong> </span>When the sun is not enough in the winter, it is necessary to use a light lamp to supplement light.</p>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<p><span>🍃</span>Now the weather is turning warm. We can put the succulents outdoors (10-25 degrees is the best temperature) and pay attention to put them in the shade or keep the astigmatism maintenance. The succulents can also get direct sunlight, but the process is step by step. We can't put them under the sun too long at once. For example, we could have 2 hours of direct sunlight per day in the first week, 3 hours in the second week, 4 hours in the third week, and so on.</p>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<p><span>🍃</span>If we do not have sunlight and a lamp during the wintertime, we can lengthen the watering cycle and reduce water quantity, preventing the succulents from growing too tall. The next spring, when the sun comes out, we can keep the normal maintenance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><b>CONCLUSION</b></strong></p>
<p>Springer Garden offers solutions for your succulents’ problems. The above-mentioned types of soils are all suitable for succulents provided that you give the plants the required maximum attention.</p>
<p>Each gardener has their own soil preference. Plus you can always try more than one soil type. Why don’t you decorate your home with Springer Garden succulents this coming summer or winter?</p>
<p>If you put your succulents under the sun properly, they will get color on, like the ones below:</p>

<p>Basically, before putting your plants in a new planter, prepare the <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/soil-fertilizer"><strong><b>soil</b></strong></a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/tools/products/diy-tool-set?variant=37312666042528"><strong><b>planting tool</b></strong></a></span>, and the<span><a href="https://www.springergarden.com/collections/planters"><strong><b> </b></strong><strong><b>planter</b></strong></a></span><strong><b>.</b></strong></p>
<p><strong><b> </b></strong></p>
<h4>1st step: Wash</h4>
<p>Clean the soil around succulents' roots as far as possible, ensure that you don't put any pest into a new bowl, and reoccupy carbendazim bubble bath, to prevent diseases.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>2nd step: Cut</h4>
<p>Cut off any dry roots to stimulate the growth of succulents.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>3rd step: Blow</h4>
<p>Air the succulents to dry in a cool and ventilated place, avoid wound infection, remember, do not insolate. Finishing these steps can greatly prevent succulents from insect pests and diseases.</p>
